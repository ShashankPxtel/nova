                By accessing or using Nova, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you don't agree with any part of these terms, you shouldn't use the service. We try to keep things simple, but security is a shared responsibility.

                Nova provides AI-assisted phishing analysis. While we strive for high accuracy, our verdicts are intended as decision-support tools. No security tool is 100% foolproof, and you are responsible for the final security decisions you make based on our reports.
